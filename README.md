**boba game**

game length: ~5min

quite simple really, just follow the "console" instructions. 
the goal is to make $10 making boba for a boba gift card. Once that is complete there isn't really much more content to explore. The roadmap for the future may include a prestige system but once I submit for the competition ill fork this so that there's a legacy version
